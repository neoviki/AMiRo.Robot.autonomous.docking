AMiRo-LLD is a compilation of low-level hardware drivers for the base version of
the Autonomous Mini Robot (AMiRo) [1]. It provides directional interfaces for an
operating system to access the drivers and for the drivers to access the
communication infrastructure via the operating system.

AMiRo-LLD is a compilation of low-level hardware drivers, originally developed
for the Autonomous Mini Robot (AMiRo) [1]. It provides a modular design, so that
each driver can be (de)activated individually as required. Interface functions
allow for bidirectional comunication with an operating system. On the one hand
drivers access according hardware interfaces via defined interface functions
(which need to be implemented by the operating system) and any applications (or
the operating system itself) can take advantage of the drivers by their
individual interfaces. The abstraction layer of the hardware interfaces is
called "periphAL", which is defined by this project.

Although this compilation was originally designed to be used in combination with
the AMiRo operating system (AMiRo-OS; cf. https://opensource.cit-ec.de/projects/amiro-os/),
it is not limited to this use case. The included drivers may be used for any
purpose and contributions of further drivers, even if the according hardware is
not present on the AMiRo platform, are highly appreciated.

The files are structured as follows:
* include/
  Each driver defines exactly one include header in this directory. By
  convention these files are named by the form
    alld_<product_name>.h
  <product_name> is a placeholder for the exact name of the according hardware,
  or the product familiy, if the driver is compatible with all parts.
* source/
  Any source files are placed in this directory. Usually there is a single file
  for each driver. If multiple files are necessary, these should be placed in an
  accordingly named subfolder. Names of folders and files should comply to the
  aforementioned convention.
* templates/
  AMiRo-LLD requires an implementation of the defined interface and an
  configuration header to be accessible in the include paths at compile time.
  Template files for both can be found in this folder. It is recommended to
  place according implementations of these templated not in the AMiRo-LLD
  project, but the superproject which includes AMiRo-LLD.
* /
  The project root directory contains this file, a license.html file as well as
  a Makefile that allows to easily integrate the project. Furthermore, two
  interface headers are provided: amiro-lld.h and periphALtypes.h. These are
  entry points for any utilizing superproject, so it is not required (and not
  recommanded) to include each driver individually.
